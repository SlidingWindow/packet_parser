# Packet Parser
Process network packets while sniffing or reading from PCAP files.

# This is what it can do:
  1. Read a PCAP file.
  2. Extract HTTP requests and dump those into a JSON file.
  3. Extract HTTP Responses and dump those into a JSON file.
  4. Extract images from HTTP Responses and save them to current directory.
  
# To Do:
  1. Save full duplex (HTTP Request + Response) in a JSON file.
  2. Extract other content-types from HTTP Responses.
  3. Support other common network protocols.
  4. Do all of the above while in Sninff() mode.
  5. And much more!
